## Technical details
Inspired by an [article](https://sspai.com/post/47192 ), the collection of resource sites for the bookmark bar is used.

How is the site built?

- Access the HTML file in the Github project by adding the `http://htmlpreview.github.com/?` link to the project source code page link prefix;
- Ads appearing in Custom Search can be removed using the Adblock or Stylus plugin;
- The appearance of the webpage Fork from https://github.com/bestony/sspai-cse ;
- Google Custom Search Engine: https://cse.google.com/cse/all

## NG
